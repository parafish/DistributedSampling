QUICK START
--------------------
1. Prerequisites
	The only requirement for running the code is a Hadoop cluster, with either
	new or old APIs. The code works with Hadoop-0.20.0 or higher.

2. Build
	$ mvn clean compile assembly:single 

3. Frequency-based sampling
	Below we show how our frequency-based sampling runs on a small dataset (iris).
	The same procedure applies to arbitrarily large datasets in the fimi format.
	If one wants to control the number of mappers, the generic parameters
		-D mapred.min.split.size
		-D mapred.map.tasks
	should be considered.

3.1 Upload the fimi-format data
	$ hadoop fs -put \
		demo/iris.dat	\
		dps/iris.dat

3.2 Sample 100 samples from the uploaded data
	$ hadoop jar \
		target/dps-0.0.2-jar-with-dependencies.jar	\
		freq	\
		dps/iris.dat	\
		dps/output/freq-iris	\
		100

3.3 See the sample
	$ hadoop fs -cat dps/output/freq-iris/part-00000
	
	The first column is the key of the sample records, 
	and second column is the sampled patterns.

4. Discriminativity-based sampling
	Below we show how our discriminativity-based sampling runs on a small 
	dataset (iris).	
	For simplicity, the positive set and the negative set are the same ---
	the entire iris dataset.
	In real practice, the positive set and the negative set should be two
	different directories or files.

4.1 Upload the fimi-format data
	$ hadoop fs -put 	\
		demo/iris.dat	\
		dps/iris/positive	
	$ hadoop fs -put	\
		demo/iris.dat	\
		dps/iris/negative

4.2 Expand the negative (or positive) set
	$ hadoop jar	\
		target/dps-0.0.2-jar-with-dependencies.jar	\
		expand	\
		dps/iris/negative	\
		dps/iris/negative-expanded	

4.3 Sample 100 samples from the uploaded data
	$ hadoop jar	\
		target/dps-0.0.2-jar-with-dependencies.jar	\
		disc	\
		-D dps.right.line.length=13	\
		dps/iris/positive	\
		dps/iris/negative-expanded/negative-expanded-13	\
		dps/output/disc-iris	\
		100

	Please notice that the parameter 
		-D dps.right.line.length 
	must be set to the actual line length of the negative set.
	This length is indicated by the last number in the directory name 
		dps/iris/negative-expanded-13

4.4 See the sample
	$ hadoop fs -cat dps/output/disc-iris/part-00000

	The first column is the key of the sample tuples, 
	and second column is the sampled patterns.
